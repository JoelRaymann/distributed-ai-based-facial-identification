# Introduction

A Distributed AI-based Facial Identification developed in Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop and TensorFlow.
we will leverage the state-of-the-art facial detection and recognition techniques along with modern big-data framework to achieve a fully distributed scalable AI-driven Facial Lookup system. We have proposed two architectures namely, Fully-Spark Architecture and Spark-GPU Hybrid Cluster Architecture. The Fully-Spark Architecture is designed for complete CPU-based Architecture while the Spark-GPU Hybrid Cluster Architecture is designed to leverage both CPU and GPU-based clusters. We have implemented the project using Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop and TensorFlow.
